| H-1  | High     | StakingverseVault.sol                 | First depositor exploit due to flawed share calculation                  | High       | Share price inflation                                   | ✅ Fixed. Same finding than in MiloTruck audit. Commented in the source code as warning. This contract is used for an upgrade so it will not apply.                                                                                                 |
| M-1  | Medium   | StakingverseVault.sol                 | Single oracle has unilateral power to register validators and rebalance  | Medium     | Potential manipulation of vault balance                 | ☑️ Acknowledged. Design decision. There are no single oracle that have unilateral power. Oracles are controlled by the admin. If an oracle address is compromised, the operator can register another oracle address and remove the compromised one. |
| M-2  | Medium   | StakingverseVault.sol                 | Insufficient validation in validator registration                        | Medium     | Incorrect validator registrations                       | ⚪️ Not Applicable / False Positive. Deposit contract on mainnet perform these checks already. https://explorer.lukso.network/address/0xCAfe00000000000000000000000000000000CAfe?tab=contract                                                       |
| M-3  | Medium   | StakingverseVault.sol                 | Pending withdrawal rebalancing vulnerability                             | Medium     | Manipulated withdrawal state                            | ☑️ Acknowledged. The oracle of Stakingverse can be trusted.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| M-4  | Medium   | SLYXToken.sol                         | Reentrancy risk in `_afterTokenTransfer` during burn                     | Medium     | Possible reentrancy attack                              | ✅ Mitigated. The `transferStake(...)` function in the `StakingverseVault` contract contains a `nonReentrant` modifier, which mitigates this issue.                                                                                                 |

Not clear, the issue description seems very broad and not clear to me                                                                                                                                          |
| L-1  | Low      | SLYXToken.sol                         | Use of TransparentUpgradeableProxy assumptions in `_beforeTokenTransfer` | Low        | Possible failure on upgrade                             | ✅ Fixed. The `implementation()` function can only be called by the proxy admin, which would lead to this internal call to fail. This check was removed.                                                                                            |
| L-2  | Low      | StakingverseVault.sol                 | Operators can adjust fee and deposit limit without timelock              | Low        | Centralized control risk                                | ☑️ Acknowledged. Operator is controlled mainly by Stakingverse. Would not be the case that drastic fee changes occur out of the sudden. If fee changes, these are communicated to the communities.                                                  |

We know already and cannot really change much in the logic because it is already deployed and upgrading could incur risks.                                                                                                         |

Check for `address(0)` is performed in the inheritance of the contract.                                                                                                                                        |

The description of the issue is not clear.                                                                                                                                                                     |
